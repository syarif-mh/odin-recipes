    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>As far as fall baking goes, there are other flavors that hog the limelight (we're looking at you, pumpkin spice!). The humble persimmon is oft forgotten, except by those who already love its honey-like flavor and know that it is only available to enjoy during a short season.</p>
    <p>Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of persimmon pulp. Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the sweet flesh is easy to scoop away from the persimmon skin with a spoon. For 1 cup of persimmon pulp, you'll need 2 to 3 hachiya persimmons, depending on their size. You can also use smaller fuyu persimmons, which typically take longer to fully ripen than hachiya.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 cup persimmon pulp</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x4-inch pan.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, cinnamon, salt, nuts, and raisins in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Blend eggs, sugar, and oil in a large bowl. Stir baking soda into persimmon pulp until well blended; add to sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Fold in flour mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
